# XMLBombExample
An xml that expands until the server crashes. If you're lucky, you'll hear a *BOOM* from the server farm next street.

## Yea, cool, but how the frick does this work?!?
It actually really simple. Its just one String a few times in another a few times in another a few times in another a few times in another... That's it. It's just dublicating Strings, until the XML processor crashes.

## How do I protect my server against this?
Get a bomb defuse robot or just don't use XML.

## Disclaimer
Don't use this in real cases. This project is for educational purposes only! It's technically a DOS attack. These attacks are illegal in most countries!


This is unfinished btw, that's why this file is such shit.
